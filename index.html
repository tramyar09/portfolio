        <h3>Design and Development</h3>
        <p>I started coding recently in my College years of Engineer. But as time goes by I got hooked into coding and building Application and Software but also a Full-Functional Website.</p>

        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <p>My second skill is probably cooking, and I can say that confidently. It was the first degree I took when I was still in Cavite, and I have some experience cooking in the real world of the cooking industry. I was once assigned as a Pantry Chef, where all the magic and fast-paced cooking happened.
